            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <div class="CompAnalysis">
              <p>For my competitive analysis, I researched three restaurants Uncle Julio’s, Cheddar’s, and Spiral.
                Uncle Julio’s is a Tex-Mex restaurant that promises that its food is made from scratch.
                They have a very detailed menu but they lacked images and prices. One weakness on their
                menu was that the customers only get to see the prices of their dishes if they decide to
                order online.  One strength is that they offered the opportunity to reserve right on their
                website through OpenTable. </p>
              <p>Cheddar’s makes their menu the focal point of their landing page. This restaurant was the strongest
                on the visual presentation of their food. Their menu shows pictures for their dishes and included a
                description of ingredients as well as prices. The two main options on their website are their Menu and
                Location since this is the restaurant with the most locations they made easy to access their contact
                information this way. </p>
              <p>Spiral is a vegan and vegetarian restaurant. Their website offers a great menu which included the prices
                 and well-detailed description of the ingredients but lacks images of the dishes. Their contact
                 information can be found on the Contact option of their menu and also at the bottom of the page on
                 their Menu page. They also made their social media, Facebook and Instagram, as part of their menu on
                 the landing page but they disappear after clicking on the menu.</p>
              <p class="lastParagraph">While I was researching these three restaurants I saw what I wanted to include in my design. I saw how
              they implemented the main features that the people who were surveyed said were important to them such as
              the menu with pictures, ingredients, and prices, as well as how they displayed their contact information,
              and also their about page. Analyzing these restaurants made me get an idea of what I wanted my design to
              include and how to display it better in a way that would satisfy the vision of my client.</p>

            <div class="mockups-Intro">
              <p>After submitting my work to a critique by one of the design teachers she said that
                she didn’t know what type of restaurant it was so that I probably needed to add a section
                at the top explaining that before I got into the specials of the day so the changes can
                be seen below. Another thing changed here was the complementary typeface, since first I had
                Playfair Display as the complementary font to be used only on parts where I needed to use a
                bigger font but the teacher said that it had some parts that were really thin and it didn’t
                quite work when I use a picture in the background since it had too much going on it didn’t
                make the font look good. She suggested to use my primary font, Josefin Sans, for those parts
                and to find a complementary font that worked better. The grading team also told me that making
                my buttons the same width and height on all my pages would improve my design. And the final
                revision I made to version two was to also add the hours to the footer and removing the logo
                from it and also make the icons horizontally instead of vertically.</p>

              <p>I also asked my peers their opinion on my design of the website and one of them suggested
                that the menu was too short that it almost didn’t look like it was for a restaurant and she
                didn’t know what the dropdown menu was for so for that part I decided to add an appetizers
                section to the menu that way it would show the design a little more interactive. Below are

              first picture didn’t compliment the second picture so for that
              part I decided to change both pictures which had the same kind of
              ambiance to give the About page a better look.</p>

              go for clickable written links. Another suggestion he gave was to

          <div class="brandingintro brandingIntroRoyal">
            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>When I first started my sketching for the logo I used the name of the
               restaurant as Royal Blue and I had this idea that I wanted to make a
               chef’s hat kind of like a crown that would sit on the “O” of Royal but
                seeing it drawn didn’t make it seem right. So then I moved onto just
                adding the name of the restaurant next to a chef’s hat, eventually,
                I changed the hat for a pan but nothing seemed to work out. Then I got
                this idea that since I wanted the name to be Royal maybe adding a crown
                and replacing its’ peeks with forks and spoons would actually work so
                after I digitize that version I found that the crown looked better
                if I made all the peeks forks and added the spoons in the middle to
                make them look like jewels. After that, I just had to find the perfect
                font to compliment the name of the restaurant and it was at this time
                that I decided the name Royal Cuisine sounded better than Royal Blue
                so I changed it. Below are the sketches of the logo and the final
                design of the logo.</p>

            <h5>Color Palette</h5>
            <p>For my color palette, I chose royal blue to accentuate the name of the
              restaurant since blue represents royalty and then a complementary shade
               of yellow for the crown since these colors work well together. I also
               chose white as the main color since when using the logo on a darker
               background the blue that was going to be used in the name of the
               restaurant would get lost so in this case, changing the color of the
               restaurant from blue to white seems appropriate.</p>

              <h5>Typography</h5>
              <p>The font I chose to use as the primary typeface is Josefin Sans and the
                complementary font was Roboto. These fonts complement each other well
                since they both are easy to read but Josefin Sans works better to be
                used on the headings and bodies that contain a small amount of text
                and Roboto works well when reading long paragraphs of text.</p>

            <h3>User Testing Results</h3>
            <p>For the usability testing, I tested three subjects on site. They
            took an average of seven minutes to do the tasks I asked them to perform
            which were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Find the menu</li>
              <li>Find the specials</li>

            <h5>Changes Applied</h5>
            <p>One of the subjects couldn’t find the appetizers at all so she
            gave up and I had to move onto the next task. The second subject
            also had difficulty finding the appetizers and browse until she
            could figure out where she would find them. The third subject had no
            problem with this task or any of the rest. Seeing as two of the
            three subjects had a hard time finding the appetizers I had to
            revise that section of my design. Instead of a dropdown menu, I
            chose to display the options for the menu on a row headline style
            and just highlight the section that was in use while muting those
            who weren’t.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>With this project I managed to design a website that contained
            all the parts needed to satisfy the needs of the client. The MVP I
            designed contained some of the most important features the people
            surveyed thought it was important on a restaurant, such as a full
            menu with pictures, ingredients, and prices, as well as the contact
            information and the hours of the business.</p>
            <p>One of the things I still need to remember is to align better
            ‘cause that seemed to be a pattern I was told to revise when
            submitting my project for revision. Overall, this design didn’t
            require such big changes that would make me spend lots of extra time
            in it so with constant practice I think I will eventually remember
            to not make small mistakes that can ruin the whole design. </p>
