        <p>The client wants an app for a cloud storage service but they’re not sure what type
          of app they want. He gave as examples Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pinterest, etc.
         They only know that they want the app to be able to save content from the web, organize
         content, create content, upload content, and allow for collaboration.</p>

              <p>Since the client didn’t know the audience he was aiming for but gave as an example
                three of these competitors, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Pinterest, I decided to focus

                analysis of those three services:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Dropbox and Google Drive offer similar services.</li>
                <li>Dropbox offers the original Microsoft Office, which includes    Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint, while Google Drive offers a very similar platform.</li>
                <li>Dropbox offers a 2GB of free storage while Google Drive offers 15GB.</li>
                <li>Pinterest doesn’t have a storage limit since it’s mostly used to save links of interesting things found on the web.</li>

              refined wireframe. In the wireframe for the desktop version you can see a few of the
              changes higlighted that I added after revising the sketch. More information was added as shown by
              changes in the red boxes. I added more detailed information like the plans availabe
             the cloud service would offer. I also added more visual changes to make the landing page more appealing.

              the alignment of the previous section. After I received input, I also added some description below the

                name seemed too much so I decided to remove it. I also added a trash icon to the menu
                since I had missed it before and I wanted it to be on an easy to find placehh for the user.</p>

                The second wireframe shows the changes I made after adding more details. First, I added the screen that would
                be the first screen shown when opening the app and I made the "login/sign up" screen the second screen.
                Other changes I made were that I made the "plans available" section more visually appealing plus I also added
                more information according to the changes made on the desktop version. In the "get access to" screen I
                decided to change how the images were shown by adding an arrow on the right side of the image to change
                to the next option instead of having the user sroll down to see the other options. These changes were also added
                to the "create" section to keep the same visual throughout the page.</p>

          <div class="brandingintro">
            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>When I  started sketching the logo I was going to use in my design I thought to
              research some Aztec or Mayan symbols to see if there was a symbol that represented a
              cloud but there was just some that represented the sky and one that had a cloud in it
              that was the symbol for a person. However, I found they didn’t really represent what
              the product did so I started sketching other options. Since I was designing a cloud
              storage service I decided that I needed to include a cloud in my design then at this
              point I was trying to figure out what to name it and I decided to look at the etymology
              of the word “archive” and found out that “archia” was a Latin origin for archive so I
              decided to use that for my design by adding the “a” into the cloud and then my logo
              evolved from there.</p>

            <p>For the brand colors I wanted to give the brand a feel of security so I chose to go with a dark blue similar to the color of some police officers’ uniforms. After I chose to give the color blue to the “a” in  the logo and make my cloud white I then chose the remaining color by finding a color that would match the blue I had already chosen. Below are the main colors chosen for the brand.</p>

              <h5>Typography</h5>
              <p>For the typography for the cloud storage I wanted to choose a font
                that conveyed simplicity and was easy to read. However for the prymary
                typeface I wanted to find a font that complimented the cloud in the logo, in this case
                that font was Rasa. For the complimentary font I chose to use PT Sans because it
                is easy to read and had that simplicity I wanted to implement but it also worked
                well with the prymary typeface.</p>

            <h3>User Testing Results</h3>
            <p>During my first round of testing, I tested three subjects, two on-site and
              one remote. They were asked to perform three tasks:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sign up for a new account</li>
              <li>Upload an item</li>
              <li>Organize an item</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="changesApplied">
            <h5>Changes Applied</h5>
            <p>The change that was made after the first testing with three subjects was
              to add an “upload” button to the side menu to make it easier to find and
              therefore reducing the time when uploading an item.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Other changes made after first testing was fixing the alignment on the
              side menu, removing the “my files” button since the tabs performed the
              same tasks and therefore was redundant, and changing the color of the
              “sign out” button to make it more compatible with the color used on the menu. </p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>After my second round of testing, I changed the color of the lines on the
              tabs and muted the tabs not in use, since the subjects kept clicking on them
              when asked to organize a file into folders.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Other changes that I made after receiving input from my mentor was to improve
              my pricing tables since they still needed a little improvement and also move
              them almost at the end after the introduction of the features. Plus also added
              a section about what people using the service think of it to show prospective
              users how real people feel about the service.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Other changes made after receiving input from my mentor were to the mobile
              version. I was told that my onboarding had too many steps and that the color
              also needed to match my main colors more. The changes I did was to remove the
              sliding screen options and instead applied an auto rotating effect so the user
              would just have the option to sign in while seeing the features available.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Other improvements were that I removed other social media buttons on the sign
              in/login page to both mobile and desktop versions to focus more on getting the
              users to use the client’s service.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, I was surprised at how many steps it actually takes to make a
              barely functional prototype. Even though I didn’t design every single detail
              that still needs to be designed, I did an incredible amount of wireframes that
              even I was surprised by how they just kept coming. Every time I fixed something
              I had to go back and applied that change to all of the wireframes so it was
              very time-consuming.</p>
            <p>I learned that I need to be careful with my spacing and alignment from the
              beginning because if I’m not doing it it will be time-consuming later trying to
              fix it on all wireframes. I also learned that I need to keep some type of journal
              with all the changes I’ve made along the way. That would help me when I have to
              write a case study like this for other projects, having a place with all the
              details that have been changed will ultimately save me a lot of time at the end.</p>
