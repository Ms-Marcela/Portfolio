        <p>The client wants an app for a cloud storage service but they’re not sure what type of app they want. He gave as examples Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pinterest, etc. They only know that they want the app to be able to save content from the web, organize content, create content, upload content, and allow for collaboration.</p>

        <div class="CompAnalysis">
          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>Since the client didn’t know the audience he was aiming for but gave as an example three of these competitors, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Pinterest, I decided to focus on researching those three. </p>
          <p>These are some of the findings that I discovered after doing my competitive analysis of those three services:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dropbox and Google Drive offer similar services.</li>
            <li>Dropbox offers the original Microsoft Office, which includes    Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint, while Google Drive offers a very similar platform.</li>
            <li>Dropbox offers a 2GB of free storage while Google Drive offers 15GB.</li>
            <li>Pinterest doesn’t have a storage limit since it’s mostly used to save links of interesting things found on the web.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Analyzing these types of services next to each other helped me understand what would work and what wouldn’t in the creation of a cloud storage service. It showed me the things that I would need to focus in order to make the service more appealing to the users. </p>

          <h3>Branding</h3>
          <p>When I  started sketching the logo I was going to use in my design I thought to research some Aztec or Mayan symbols to see if there was a symbol that represented a cloud but there was just some that represented the sky and one that had a cloud in it that was the symbol for a person. However, I found they didn’t really represent what the product did so I started sketching other options. Since I was designing a cloud storage service I decided that I needed to include a cloud in my design then at this point I was trying to figure out what to name it and I decided to look at the etymology of the word “archive” and found out that “archia” was a Latin origin for archive so I decided to use that for my design by adding the “a” into the cloud and then my logo evolved from there.</p>

          <h5>Color Palette</h5>
          <p>For the brand colors I wanted to give the brand a feel of security so I chose to go with a dark blue similar to the color of some police officers’ uniforms. After I chose to give the color blue to the “a” in  the logo and make my cloud white I then chose the remaining color by finding a color that would match the blue I had already chosen. Below are the main colors chosen for the brand.</p>

          <p>Finally, here are the final prototypes after multiple changes in colors and fixing the spacing on many things. Also, my final landing page changed a lot to make it look easier to navigate after the various inputs I received. I will explain in more detail some of the changes I applied.</p>

          <h3>User Testing Results</h3>
          <p>During my first round of testing, I tested three subjects, two on-site and one remote. They were asked to perform three tasks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sign up for a new account</li>
            <li>Upload an item</li>
            <li>Organize an item</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Changes Applied</h5>
          <p>The change that was made after the first testing with three subjects was to add an “upload” button to the side menu to make it easier to find and therefore reducing the time when uploading an item.</p>
          <div>
            <img src="" alt="Desktop dashboard wireframe">
          </div>
          <div>
            <img src="" alt="Desktop dashboard first mockup">
          </div>
          <p>Other changes made after first testing was fixing the alignment on the side menu, removing the “my files” button since the tabs performed the same tasks and therefore was redundant, and changing the color of the “sign out” button to make it more compatible with the color used on the menu. </p>
          <div>
            <img src="" alt="Desktop dashboard first mockup">
          </div>
          <div>
            <img src="" alt="Desktop dashboard second mockup">
          </div>
          <p>After my second round of testing, I changed the color of the lines on the tabs and muted the tabs not in use, since the subjects kept clicking on them when asked to organize a file into folders.</p>

            <img src="" alt="Desktop dashboard final mockup">
          </div>
          <p>Other changes that I made after receiving input from my mentor was to improve my pricing tables since they still needed a little improvement and also move them almost at the end after the introduction of the features. Plus also added a section about what people using the service think of it to show prospective users how real people feel about the service.</p>

          <div>
            <img src="" alt="Second high fi landing page">
          </div>
          <p>Other changes made after receiving input from my mentor were to the mobile version. I was told that my onboarding had too many steps and that the color also needed to match my main colors more. The changes I did was to remove the sliding screen options and instead applied an auto rotating effect so the user would just have the option to sign in while seeing the features available.</p>

            <img src="" alt="Final high fi mobile onboarding">
          </div>
          <p>Other improvements were that I removed other social media buttons on the sign in/login page to both mobile and desktop versions to focus more on getting the users to use the client’s service.</p>

        <!--Conclusion section-->
        <div>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>In conclusion, I was surprised at how many steps it actually takes to make a barely functional prototype. Even though I didn’t design every single detail that still needs to be designed, I did an incredible amount of wireframes that even I was surprised by how they just kept coming. Every time I fixed something I had to go back and applied that change to all of the wireframes so it was very time-consuming.</p>
          <p>I learned that I need to be careful with my spacing and alignment from the beginning because if I’m not doing it it will be time-consuming later trying to fix it on all wireframes. I also learned that I need to keep some type of journal with all the changes I’ve made along the way. That would help me when I have to write a case study like this for other projects, having a place with all the details that have been changed will ultimately save me a lot of time at the end.</p>
