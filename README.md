# My Portfolio

A showcase of my work at Bloc.
This is my UX Designer Portfolio designed during my time as a student at Bloc. This portfolio shows some of the projects I worked on during my time at Bloc and will also be used to showcase my future projects as a UX Designer.

## Homepage

The  first part of the Homepage contains a simple introduction of who I am and what I do as well as the menu at the top right corner.

The second part of the Homepage contains the projects that will be featured on the main page. On the left is how the normal image for the project looks like and on the right is how the image looks like when you hover over them. Once the button is clicked it will redirect to the case study for each project.
