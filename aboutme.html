            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>My name is Marcela Lopez and I am one of eight siblings to a single mother. When I was young I didn’t have the access to computers at an early age that I would’ve hoped for. I was born in Mexico and raised in Irapuato, a city in the state of Guanajuato famous for its strawberry plantations. My earliest memory of a computer was watching Doogie Howser blogging at the end of an episode and thinking that computers were so cool. I knew that in my future I wanted to work on something related to computers.</p>
            <p>My chance to get to know them better came up until I entered high school. The high school I enrolled in had a course that would focused only on computers for the three years that I was to spend there. I remember learning Basic, Fox, and Corel Draw among others. That was a long time ago and my knowledge of all those programs has basically disappeared. The term use it or lose it comes to mind in this situation.</p>

            <p>After emigrating to the US in 2000, I learned English while attending a high school that specializes on teaching foreign students. Unfortunately, I didn’t pursue my education on computers. Finally last year, I decided that I was going to take a leap of faith and enroll in a program that would teach me the basics of web design. I have learned so much along the way that I didn’t even know that design was the other half of web development. I’m starting as a web designer but I also want to someday be able to jump into web development. I hope this is the first step of the many I will take on my way to a fulfilling career. I want to design having the needs of others in mind and I hope that my designs help make someone's life easier.</p>
